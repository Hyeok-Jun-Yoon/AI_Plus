# Fashion Recommendation System Based on Purchase History
## This project provides a fashion recommendation system that suggests clothing items based on a user's purchase history. By leveraging advanced models like CLIP for image-text embeddings and GPT-4 for generating personalized fashion recommendations, the system is capable of recommending outfits that suit the user's style preferences.

## Features
* Recommends fashion items based on previous purchases.
* Utilizes images of purchased items and text prompts to generate tailored recommendations.
* Uses CLIP model for image-text embeddings and GPT-4 for generating recommendations.
* Provides visual and textual descriptions of recommended items.
## Technologies Used
* CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining): For embedding images and text into a shared space.
* GPT-4: For generating natural language responses based on the embeddings.
* Python Libraries: PyTorch, OpenAI API, Transformers, etc.
## Usage
1. Upload Your Images
Prepare the images of the clothing items you've purchased (e.g., jackets, pants, shoes).
